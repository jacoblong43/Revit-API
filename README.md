# Basic Revit API Coding
This is a repository for those learning the Revit API, Revit Macros, Revit Commands, and Revit Applications.
This includes, but not limited to, Simple functioning add-ins, Adding new panels, Retrieve selected/filtered elements, read/write from Revit, etc.

It will be updated as I continue to work on bits & pieces and I will try to comment as much as possible, so new users will understand.

## Software Needed
Before doing anything please install Revit 2018 as well as Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017. Make sure the download for Visual 
Studio includes the .NET Framework 4.7.1 Version. This will be the version I am using. I also have the Revit Software Development Kit, as well as Resharper, a visual studio extension that is free for students, though these are not a requirement to have.

##### -- Essential --
[Revit 2018](https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/revit "Free for students") - Free for students.

[Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/ "Free :)") - Free for everyone.

##### -- Recommended but unessential --
[Revit 2018.2 SDK](https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/revit "Very Helpful :)") - (Software Development Kit) Is very helpful for debugging the Revit Database and understanding the elements and how their parameters operate.

[ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/ "Free for students") - Free for students/Visual studio extension.

## Macro VS Command/Application
There are three options for the type of Add-ins in Revit, Macro, Command, and Application. First to create a Macro, you do not need any external software (like Visual Studio) and can create AddIns inside Revit. Macros are manually started and stopped, can either be stored specifically to a single project or to the computer.

The next two are external AddIns, Commands and Applications. Commands are also manually started/stopped like a macro but are compiled into a DLL file. An example would be a user clicking a button, the button performs a function like create a 3D view from a selected region, then stops. Applications are different. An application starts with Revit and ends with Revit. They are continuously running and compiled into a DLL file as well. An example would be a ribbon toolbar that starts with Revit and is visible until Revit Closes.

## Notice
The file path that all of these programs use spawn from my “C:\Samples\” Folder. For someone to copy/download these files, they must paste them into a C drive samples folder. For example, if I wanted to add the Command “HelloWorld”, I would NOT add it like this “C:\Command\HelloWorld\\...”.
The CORRECT way would be like this, “C:\Samples\HelloWorld\\...”.
The same goes for applications as well.

The way around this would be to edit the code inside each .cs file so all the file paths match according to your computer.

## Setup Macros
To create a Macro/Paste my code all you need to do is navigate to the manage tab in Revit, then on the far right click the macro manager icon. Once the window pops up there will be two tabs, Application and your project name. If you want the Macro to be project specific, then choose the project tab. If you want the add in to be for any application, choose the Application tab. Once here create a Module and choose your program language (C#). Then, with the new module highlighted, click macro and choose your program language(C#). You should now have a macro inside your module, from here click on your macro and then click edit. Copy and paste my code.

## Setup Command/Application
When downloading these files, make sure the file path is correct due to the fact that the addin files depend on where the folders of code have been saved for each plugin.

In my instance, the folders with c# code for Visual Studio are saved here:

C:\Samples\HelloWorld\HelloWorld\bin\Debug\HelloWorld.dll

And the AddIn files are as follows:

C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\Revit\Addins\2018\HelloWorld.addin

An AddIn manifest is a file located in a specific location checked by Revit when the application starts. The manifest includes information used by Revit to load and run the plug-in. The file path to insert the AddIn file will vary depending on the location of the Revit instillation. Again, the usual path is as follows:

C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\Revit\Addins\2018\HelloWorld.addin

The year 2018 in the above file path may vary as well, depending on which version of Revit the user has. I do not recommend using a different year other than 2018 for these specific plug-ins due to the fact it may cause a myriad of errors/problems down the road (It may work fine as well, I don't know, what am I a pantomath?).

If you are rather a beginner to file navigation as well, then you may notice that “ProgramData” does not appear in the “C:\” drive options. The reason some files/folders are automatically marked as hidden is because, unlike other data like your pictures and documents, they're not files that you should be changing, deleting, or moving around. These are often important operating system-related files.

To open this folder simply type “C:\ProgramData” as the file path and click enter.

Currently there are X AddIn files. Each can be accessed/used in Revit 2018 by navigating to the AddIns tab, then clicking external tools on the far left of the screen. External tools will have a drop-down list of each AddIn command.

## References
References are a big part to coding in visual studio to keep errors at bay. Under the Solution Explorer window, right click References, then click add Reference. From here you usually will need 5 basic references that I add when starting every new project. Add as follows: RevitAPI, RevitAPIUI, PresentationCore, System.Xaml, and WindowsBase.
